Abstract:
We propose a conceptual model of a hypothetical particle capable of splitting into two temporal components: one propagating toward the future and the other toward the past. This idea, inspired by the interplay between quantum mechanics and relativity, provides a novel framework for exploring the nature of time, causality, and information exchange across temporal directions.
